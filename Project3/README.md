This program main function will be as a main arcade game. It wll generate lights, shapes and different colors in the LED screen attached to the MSP430 launchpad.

For this project I got the assistance of the shape motion demo that was in the demos folder for project 3. I got thw main idea of how to use circles and switches on the LED extra port. Also I got some ideas from different websites of the algorithms of the ping pong game.
